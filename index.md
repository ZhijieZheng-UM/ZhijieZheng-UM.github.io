Dear Recruiting Department for The University of Manitoba, <br /> <br /> 
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Caretaker position at the University of Manitoba, as advertised on UM Careers. With my dedication to cleanliness, strong work ethic, and commitment to maintaining a safe and harmonious environment, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the upkeep of the campus and support the well-being of students and staff.

As a recent graduate from the University of Manitoba, I have honed my attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and organizational skills through academic pursuits and diverse experiences. My passion for cleanliness and maintenance is reflected in my background of self-house cleaning, where I have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to maintaining an orderly living space. This experience instilled in me the value of a well-kept environment, which I believe will enable me to excel in maintaining the facilities at the University of Manitoba to the highest standards.

My maintenance skills encompass a thorough understanding of cleaning equipment and procedures. I possess hands-on experience in vacuuming, waste disposal, disinfection, and minor maintenance tasks. My ability to adapt to changing situations and work both independently and collaboratively ensures my effectiveness in managing diverse caretaking responsibilities. Furthermore, my proficiency in supply management and attention to detail enable me to consistently deliver exceptional results.

My personal commitment to safety is underscored by my valid Class 5 driver's license with a clean record, reflecting my dedication to responsible vehicle operation and adherence to safety standards. In addition, my ability to adapt to outdoor work in various weather conditions demonstrates my resilience and dedication to fulfilling duties regardless of environmental challenges.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and dedication to creating a safe, inviting, and well-maintained environment for the University of Manitoba's students and staff. I am confident in my ability to exceed expectations and look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Enclosed is my resume, which provides further details about my qualifications. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with the requirements of the Caretaker position and how I can contribute to your team. Thank you for considering my application. <br /> 

Sincerely, <br /> 
Zhijie Zheng
